It allows us to specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.\n\nFunctions allow us to reuse the code instead of writing the code again and again. If you recall strings and lists, remember that len() function is used to find the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task, you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.\n\nFunction is one of the most basic levels of reusing code in Python, and it will also allow us to start thinking of program design.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## def Statements\n\nNow, let us learn how to build a function and what is the syntax in Python.\n\nThe syntax for def statements will be in the following form:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def name_of_function(arg1,arg2):\n    '''\n    This is where the function's Document String (doc-string) goes\n    '''\n    # Do stuff here\n    #return desired result","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We begin with def then a space followed by the name of the function.

Also be careful with names, you wouldn't want to call a function the same name as a [built-in function in Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) (such as len).\n\nNext, comes the number of arguments separated by a comma within a pair of parenthesis which acts as input to the defined function,  reference them and the function definition with a colon.  \n\nHere comes the important step to indent to begin the code inside the defined functions properly. Also remember, Python makes use of *whitespace* to organize code and lot of other programming languages do not do this.\n\nNext, you'll see the doc-string where you write the basic description of the function. Using iPython and iPython Notebooks, you'll be able to read these doc-strings by pressing Shift+Tab after a function name. It is not mandatory to include docstrings with simple functions, but it is a good practice to put them as this will help the programmers to easily understand the code you write.\n\nAfter all this, you can begin writing the code you wish to execute.\n\nThe best way to learn functions is by going through examples.

In Python, Generator function allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it was left. It also allows us to generate a sequence of values over time. The main difference in syntax will be the use of a **yield** statement.\n\nIn most aspects, a generator function will appear very similar to a normal function. The main difference is when a generator function is called and compiled they become an object that supports an iteration protocol. That means when they are called they don't actually return a value and then exit, the generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation. \n\nThe main advantage here is \"state suspension\" which means, instead of computing an entire series of values upfront and the generator functions can be suspended.

It then returns a single value. \n\nIf seq = [s1, s2, s3, ... , sn], calling reduce(function, sequence) works like this:\n\n* At first the first two elements of sequence will be applied to function, i.e. func(s1,s2) \n* The list on which reduce() works looks like this: [ function(s1, s2), s3, ... , sn ]\n* In the next step the function will be applied on the previous result and the third element of the list, i.e. function(function(s1, s2),s3)\n* The list looks like: [ function(function(s1, s2),s3), ... , sn ]\n* It continues like this until just one element is left and return this element as the result of reduce()\n\nLet's see an example:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from functools import reduce\nlst =['sdfs','sdfsfsdf','sdf']\nreduce(lambda a,b: a+b,lst)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's look at a diagram to get a better understanding of what is going on here:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nImage('http://www.python-course.eu/images/reduce_diagram.png')","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note how we keep reducing the sequence until a single final value is obtained.
