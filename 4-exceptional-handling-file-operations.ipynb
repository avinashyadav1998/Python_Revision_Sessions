To create a module of your own, simply create a new .py file with the module name, and then import it using the Python file name (without the .py extension) using the import command.\n\n## Writing packages\nPackages are name-spaces which contain multiple packages and modules themselves. They are simply directories, but with a twist.\n\nThe twist is, each package in Python is a directory which MUST contain a special file called **\\__init\\__.py**. This file can be empty, and it indicates that the directory it contains is a Python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.\n\nIf we create a directory called foo, which marks the package name, we can then create a module inside that package called bar. We also must not forget to add the **\\__init\\__.py** file inside the foo directory.\n\nTo use the module bar, we can import it in two ways:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Just an example, this won't work\nimport foo.bar","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# OR could do it this way\nfrom foo import bar","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the first method, we must use the foo prefix whenever we access the module bar.

This is specific enough for us to see that we forgot a single quote at the end of the line. Understanding of these various error types will help you debug your code much faster. \n\nThis type of error and description is known as an Exception. Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal.\n\nYou can check out the full list of built-in exceptions [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html). Now, let's learn how to handle errors and exceptions in our own code.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## try and except\n\nThe basic terminology and syntax used to handle errors in Python is the **try** and **except** statements. The code which can cause an exception to occur is put in the *try* block and the handling of the exception are the implemented in the *except* block of code. The syntax form is:\n\n    try:\n       You do your operations here...\n       ...\n    except ExceptionI:\n       If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.\n    except ExceptionII:\n       If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.\n       ...\n    else:\n       If there is no exception then execute this block. \n\nUsing just except, we can check for any exception: To understand better let's check out a sample code that opens and writes a file:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n    f = open('testfile','w')\n    f.write('Test write this')\nexcept IOError:\n    # This will only check for an IOError exception and then execute this print statement\n   print(\"Error: Could not find file or read data\")\nelse:\n   print(\"Content written successfully\")\n   f.close()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, let's see what happens when we don't have write permission?

The code still ran and we were able to continue doing actions and running code blocks. This is extremely useful when you have to account for possible input errors in your code.

The syntax is:\n\n    try:\n       Code block here\n       ...\n       Due to any exception, this code may be skipped!\n    finally:\n       This code block would always be executed.\n\nFor example:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n   f = open(\"testfile\", \"w\")\n   f.write(\"Test write statement\")\nfinally:\n   print(\"Always execute finally code blocks\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can use this in conjunction with except.
